= Ruby wrapper for the Trademe API

API available at: {http://developer.trademe.co.nz}[http://developer.trademe.co.nz]

== Sample usage:

  gateway = Trademe::Gateway.new
  authorize_url = gateway.generate_request_token(callback, key, secret)
  session[:request_token] = gateway.request_token
  redirect_to authorize_url

Upon return to callback url (with params[:oauth_verifier] set):

  gateway = Trademe::Gateway.new
  gateway.request_token = session[:request_token]
  if gateway.get_access_token(params[:oauth_verifier])
    session[:access_token] = gateway.access_token
  end

You are now verified!

Currently the OAuth system has been implemented so that searches are counted against the "Authenticated rate limit" as per the Trademe website.
You can perform searches via the gateway if you have been authorized or not, but non authorized searches are limited to 60 requests per hour!

Perform API searches via:

  gateway.search "property/residential", :search_string => "flash apartment", :date_from => 4.hours.ago

This will return the parsed JSON response


== To come:

Planning to add these at some point:
* Total API coverage
* Requests for private data that needs authentication
* Write requests
